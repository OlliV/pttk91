PTTK91
======

PTTK91 is a portable implementation of TTK91 specification written in C. One of
PTTK91's goals is to integrate it with zeke project as an protected runtime
environment for it. This is interesting because zeke it self can't offer any
memory protection or privilege levels due to the limits of Cortex-M0.
